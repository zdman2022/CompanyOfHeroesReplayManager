# Company Of Heroes 3 Replay Manager

Very simple app that runs in the task tray. It automatically renames files after a match. In the tray, you should see a "C3 RE" icon that you can click to open a window. This window shows you all replays in the playback folder. You can double click a replay to watch it in COH3. Under File, you can open the playback folder or exit the app (stops the app so it's no longer in the tray and no longer automatically renaming the replay file).

Pre-Req: .NET 7.0 runtime (Download the runtime from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)

How to setup to automatically run:

* Extract zip to a location of your choosing
* Create a shortcut to the exe file
* Open the startup folder (Windows logo key + r, type shell:startup, then select OK)
* Copy and paste (or drag) the shortcut file to the Startup folder
